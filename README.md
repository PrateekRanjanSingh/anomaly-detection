## A Statistical and Machine Learning Based Approach to Anomaly Detection in Social Networks

### Software Requirements

This project uses Python 2. I have used the Anaconda distribution of python for development. It includes libraries numpy, scipy, 
pandas, sklearn, matplotlib and seaborn used in this project. Apart from these libraries, I have used the igraph library for the graph operations. All of the
mentioned libraries can be installed using *'pip install library_name'* or *'conda install library_name'* if you have the Anaconda distrinution. Refer to 
the documentation in the 'report' folder for implementation details.
